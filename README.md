# Assignment 4: Final Project Proposal

## 1. What is the goal of your application?
It will be a food “journey” website where users can keep track of what they have eaten by inputting what they ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, either at home or at a restaurant.

## 2. Who is the primary audience?
Anyone who loves to eat and who may often forget what they have eaten in the past week or so or what was the food they liked or did not like. It also helps those who love to eat, but are constantly worrying about their health. 

## 3. What will the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations be?
Users can create a food log, "read" the history of their food log, update it, and delete it.

## 4. What additional feature would you like to build?
I would like to add a favorites system so users can track the meals they particularly enjoy or would like to remember.
